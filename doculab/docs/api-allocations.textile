Allocations describe a change to the allocated quantity for a particular "Component":/api-components (either "Quantity-Based":/product-components#quantity-based-components or "On/Off":/product-components#on-off-components) for a particular "Subscription":/api-subscriptions.

Working with this resource, you can:

* "List Allocations":#list-allocations : View the history of the allocated quantity for the component over time
* "Create an Allocation":#create-an-allocation :  Set a new allocated quantity for the line-item (as an alternative to setting the allocated quantity directly on the Component Line-Item resource)
* "Create multiple Allocations":#create-multiple-allocations : Change the allocated quantity of multiple components at once

h3. Proration Schemes

Changing the allocated quantity of a component mid-period can result in either a prorated charge or adjustment being applied to the subscription. When creating an allocation via the API, you can pass the *proration_upgrade_scheme* and the *proration_downgrade_scheme* to be applied.

For background information on prorated components and upgrade/downgrade schemes, see: "API: Setting Component Allocations":/setting-component-allocations

The available 'upgrade' schemes are:

* __prorate-delay-capture__: A charge is added for the prorated amount due, but the card is not charged until the subscription's next renewal

* __prorate-attempt-capture__: A charge is added and we attempt to charge the credit card on file.  If it fails, the charge will be accrued until the next renewal.

* __full-price-attempt-capture__: A charge is added for the full price of the component change, and we attempt to charge the credit card on file.  If it fails, the charge will be accrued until the next renewal.

* __full-price-delay-capture__: A charge is added for the full price of the component change, but the card is not charged until the subscription's next renewal.

* __no-prorate__: No charge is added.

The available 'downgrade' schemes are:

* __prorate__: A credit is added for the amount owed.

* __no-prorate__: No credit is added

*NOTE*: Proration uses the current price of the component as well as the current tax rates. Changes to either may cause the prorated charge/credit to be wrong.

h2(#list-allocations). List Allocations

<pre><code>GET /subscriptions/<sub_id>/components/<comp_id>/allocations</code></pre>

Returns the 50 most recent Allocations, ordered by most recent first.

h4. Input Parameters

| @page@ | (optional) Pass an integer in the page parameter via the query string to access subsequent pages of 50 transactions |

h4. Output

An array of allocation objects with the following fields:

| @component_id@ | The integer component ID for the allocation.  This references a component that you have created in your Product setup |
| @subscription_id@ | The integer subscription ID for the allocation.  This references a unique subscription in your Site |
| @quantity@ | The allocated quantity set in to effect by the allocation |
| @previous_quantity@ | The allocated quantity that was in effect before this allocation was created |
| @memo@ | The memo passed when the allocation was created |
| @timestamp@ | The time that the allocation was recorded, in "ISO 8601":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 format and UTC timezone, i.e. @2012-11-20T22:00:37Z@ |
| @proration_upgrade_scheme@ | The scheme used if the proration was an upgrade. This is only present when the allocation was created mid-period. |
| @proration_downgrade_scheme@ | The scheme used if the proration was a downgrade. This is only present when the allocation was created mid-period. |

h4. Response Status Codes

| @200 OK@ | OK: Response returned |
| @401 Unauthorized@ | Authentication credentials were incorrect |
| @404 Not Found@ | Either no component with the given @comp_id@, or no subscription with given @sub_id@ exists |

h2(#create-an-allocation). Create an Allocation

<pre><code>POST /subscriptions/<sub_id>/components/<comp_id>/allocations</code></pre>

Creates a new Allocation, setting the current allocated quantity for the component and recording a memo.

h4. Input Fields

| @quantity@ | The allocated quantity to which to set the line-items allocated quantity.  By default, this is an integer. If decimal allocations are enabled for the component, it will be a decimal number.  For On/Off components, use @1@ for on and @0@ for off. |
| @memo@ | (optional) A memo to record along with the allocation |
| @proration_upgrade_scheme@ | (optional) The scheme used if the proration is an upgrade. Defaults to the site setting if one is not provided. |
| @proration_downgrade_scheme@ | (optional) The scheme used if the proration is a downgrade. Defaults to the site setting if one is not provided. |
| @payment_collection_method@ | (optional, default @automatic@) For subscriptions on invoice billing, when @proration_upgrade_scheme@ is set to either @prorate-attempt-capture@ or @full-price-attempt-capture@ __and__ @payment_collection_method@ is set to @invoice@, a mid-period invoice will be created from any charges that are a result of the allocation change. The charge will not appear on the invoice created at the next renewal. For subscriptions on statement billing, this option is ignored.|

h4. Output

An allocation object with the following fields:

| @component_id@ | The integer component ID for the allocation.  This references a component that you have created in your Product setup |
| @subscription_id@ | The integer subscription ID for the allocation.  This references a unique subscription in your Site |

| @previous_quantity@ | The allocated quantity that was in effect before this allocation was created |
| @memo@ | The memo passed when the allocation was created |
| @proration_upgrade_scheme@ | The scheme used if the proration was an upgrade. This is only present when the allocation was created mid-period. |
| @proration_downgrade_scheme@ | The scheme used if the proration was a downgrade. This is only present when the allocation was created mid-period. |
| @timestamp@ | The time that the allocation was recorded, in "ISO 8601":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 format and UTC timezone, i.e. @2012-11-20T22:00:37Z@ |
| @payment@ | If capture was attempted for a mid-period allocation, includes @amount_in_cents@, @success@, @memo@ and @id@ attributes describing the payment, or @null@ if no card was on file. |
