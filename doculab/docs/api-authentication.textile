The API Authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS (HTTPS).  *Your API login credentials are not the same as the credentials you use to log in to the web interface*.  You must obtain your API credentials separately.

Please note that as of January 2016, you must use TLS >= 1.2 in order to connect to the API.  See the "TLS Upgrade Notice":/tls-upgrade-notice for more information.

h3. Obtaining Your API Credentials

Your API key can be generated from the "API Access" tab of your seller dashboard.

Your http username is your "API Key".

Your "password" is always the letter "x".


h3. Authenticating with your API Credentials

You will use HTTP Basic Authentication to verify your identity via the API.  All requests must come over TLS/HTTPS, and be to the subdomain of the Site you wish to access.  For example, if your Site's subdomain is @acme@, then you would access the Customer resource at:

<pre>
  <code>https://acme.chargify.com/customers.json</code>
</pre>

h4. An example using authentication via curl:

<pre>
  <code>curl -u api-key:x https://subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml</code>
</pre>

or

<pre>
  <code>curl -i https://<api-key>:x@subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml</code>
</pre>

Please review the recommendations for setting your HTTP Accept and Content-Type headers as outlined in the "API Introduction":/api-introduction

h4(#unable-to-connect). Unable to Connect

If you are unable to connect, the problem is often that you are using an old/unsupported version of SSL or TLS.  In this case, Chargify will simply drop the connection, and the error message you receive may be cryptic.

Here are some common error messages that have been reported:

* <code>The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.  Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream.</code>

Please review the information on the "TLS Upgrade Notice":/tls-upgrade-notice in order to correct the problem.
