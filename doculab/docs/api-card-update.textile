h2. Input Attributes

In order for your request to be processed, you must set up Secure Parameters.  See "Chargify Direct Introduction - Secure Parameters":chargify-direct-introduction#secure-parameters for detailed information on how to authenticate requests to this endpoint.

Note: the @subscription_id@ MUST be part of your @secure[data]@ parameter for the card update request to be processed.

* @first_name@ (required) First name of the cardholder.
* @last_name@ (required) Last name of the cardholder.
* @card_number@ (required) The credit card number. 
* @cvv@ (optional) The 3 or 4 digit card verification value. 
* @expiration_month@ (required) The two-digit card expiration month.
* @expiration_year@ (required) The four-digit card expiration year.

The resource parameters are nested beneath a key named @payment_profile@, and are similar to the normal API inputs for the resource.
