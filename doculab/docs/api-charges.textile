For "live" subscriptions (i.e. subscriptions that are not canceled or expired) you have the ability to attach a one-time (or "one-off") charge of an arbitrary amount.  For more information on assessing charges, in general, please see "One-time Charges":/one-time-charges.

h2. Charge Input Attributes

In order to create a charge, you must pass an amount and a memo.  The amount can be specified by either the @amount@ parameter or the @amount_in_cents@ parameter.

* @amount@ (either 'amount' or 'amount_in_cents' is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass a dollar amount represented as a string.  For example, $10.00 would be represented as @10.00@.
* @amount_in_cents@ (either 'amount' or 'amount_in_cents' is required) If you use this parameter, you should pass the amount represented as a number of cents, either as a string or integer.  For example, $10.00 would be represented as @1000@.  If you pass a value for both 'amount' and 'amount_in_cents', the value in 'amount_in_cents' will be used and 'amount' will be discarded.
* @memo@ (required) A helpful explanation for the charge.  This amount will remind you and your customer for the reason for the assessment of the charge.

h2. Charge Output Attributes

When a charge is successfully created, a representation of the newly created charge will be returned to you as JSON or XML in the message body, with the following attributes:

* @success@ Either @true@ or @false@, depending on the success of the charge.  (Note: At this time, all charges that are returned will return @true@ here.  @false@ may be returned in the future when more options are added to the charge creation API)
* @amount_in_cents@ The amount of the charge and captured payment, represented in cents.
* @memo@ The memo for the created charge.

h2. Response Codes

A response code is returned in the standard HTTP response to your API request.

* @201 Created@ is returned for successfully created charges.
* @422 Unprocessable Entity@ is returned when the charge could not be created (see below section on errors)
* @404 Not Found@ is returned if the referenced subscription could not be found.

h2. Errors

Errors are returned either as an array of error explanation strings and formatted as either an XML or JSON array, depending on your Accept headers.  The listing of currently possible error messages is listed below:

* Memo: cannot be blank.
* Amount: is not a number.
* Amount: must be greater than or equal to 0.
* This subscription is not eligible to accept charges.
* [Gateway response if a gateway fail] ([Your original memo])


h2. Methods

_format_ may be either 'xml' or 'json'.

h3. Create

Creating a charge requires a valid, live subscription.  The subscription must be referenced by @id@ (available via the API when subscriptions are read or listed - "more":/api-subscriptions).

A payment in the amount of the assessed charge is automatically captured from the credit card on file for the subscription.

Please refer to the usage examples for more information.
