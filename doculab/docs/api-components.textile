h2. Component Input Attributes

* @name@ The name of the Component. i.e. Text Messages.
* @unit_name_@ (Not required for On/Off Components) The name of the unit that the component’s usage is measured in. i.e. message
* @unit_price@ The amount the customer will be charged per unit. The price can contain up to 4 decimal places. i.e. $1.00, $0.0012, etc.
* @pricing_scheme@ (Not required for On/Off Components) The handle for the pricing scheme. Available options: per_unit, volume, tiered, stairstep. See "Product Components":/product-components for an overview of pricing schemes.
* @prices@ (Not required for On/Off Components or 'per_unit' pricing schemes) One or more price brackets. See "Product Components":/product-components for an overview of how price brackets work for different pricing schemes.
** @starting_quantity@ 
** @ending_quantity@ 
** @unit_price@ 

h2. Component Output Attributes

In addition to the Input attributes, the following Output attributes are returned.

* @name@ The name of the Component. i.e. Text Messages.
* @unit_name_@ The name of the unit that the component’s usage is measured in. i.e. message
* @unit_price@ The amount the customer will be charged per unit. This field is only populated for 'per_unit' pricing schemes.
* @pricing_scheme@  The handle for the pricing scheme. Available options: per_unit, volume, tiered, stairstep. See "Product Components":/product-components for an overview of pricing schemes.
* @prices@ An array of price brackets. If the component uses the 'per_unit' pricing scheme, this array will be empty.
** @starting_quantity@ 
** @ending_quantity@ 
** @unit_price@
* @product_family_id@ The id of the Product Family that the Component belongs to
* @kind@ A handle for the component type: metered_component, quantity_based_component, on_off_component
* @price_per_unit_in_cents@ (*This field is deprecated (see note below)*) This represents the unit price prior to the Chargify upgrade to fractional cent component pricing. This field may no longer represent the correct unit price of the component. The @unit_price@ field should be used instead.

p(note). In May 2011, we added the ability to create components with fractional cent pricing (i.e. $0.0012 per unit). To accommodate this change we made some adjustments on our end that altered how prices are stored. Because of this, we have deprecated the @price_in_cents@ field in favor of the @unit_price@ field. The @price_in_cents@ field is still returned for backwards compatibility, but may not accurately represent the current state of the component if it has been updated since the change. We recommend updating your API calls to use the @unit_price@ field as soon as possible.
