Chargify offers the ability to upgrade or downgrade a Customer's subscription in the middle of a billing period, which is called a "Migration". For details on how upgrades/downgrades work, and how to initiate them through the Admin Interface, see "Upgrades/Downgrades":/upgrades-downgrades.

p(note). If you want a migration with proration, then you want to continue with the methods listed below. However, if you just want to change the product the customer is subscribed to (with no proration) then you'll just want to "update the subscription product":api-subscriptions#update.

h2. URIs

|_. Resource/URI |_. POST |
| Migrations<br/>@/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/migrations@ | "Create":#create new migration |

h2. Input Attributes

The Chargify API allows you initiate an upgrade/downgrade by posting JSON or XML that includes:

* @product_id@ or @product_handle@: The ID or handle of the Product that the subscription will migrate to
* @include_trial@: Boolean, default 0. If 1 is sent the customer will migrate to the new product with a trial if one is available. If 0 is sent, the trial period will be ignored.
* @include_initial_charge@: Boolean, default 0. If 1 is sent initial charges will be assessed. If 0 is sent initial charges will be ignored.
* @include_coupons@: Boolean, default 1. If 1 (or nothing) is sent, any coupons associated with the subscription will be applied to the migration. If 0 is sent, coupons will not be applied.
 
h2. Methods

_format_ may be either 'xml' or 'json'.
