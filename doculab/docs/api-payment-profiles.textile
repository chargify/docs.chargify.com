Creating a new payment profile for a customer via the API will not make that payment profile current for any of the customer's subscriptions.  To make a change, select the Subscription in the Admin UI and choose Payment Details, then click the 'Make Active Payment Method' link next to the desired payment profile.

h3. Update

URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/payment_profiles/<payment_profile_id>.<format>@

Response: The created payment profile (see output for "Read")

**Notes on updating payment profiles via the API**

* Merchants with Authorize.net as their payment gateway can update their customer's credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and CVV.

* If you are using Authorize.net, Chargify will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create a new payment profile for the given customer.

* A payment profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of payment profile. For example, if the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account attributes (like @bank_account_number@), and vice versa.
