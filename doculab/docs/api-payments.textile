Chargify allows you to record payments that occur outside of the normal flow of payment processing.
These payments are considered external payments. A common case to apply such a payment is when a customer pays by check or some other means for their subscription.

h3. Payment Input Attributes
* @amount@ The amount represented as a string of the payment.  E.g. if the payment was for $14.50, you would pass @14.50@
* @amount_in_cents@ The amount represented as a string of the payment in cents.  E.g. if the payment was for $14.50, you would pass @1450@
* @memo@ Typically the description of why the payment occured

h2. Methods

_format_ may be either 'xml' or 'json'.

h3. Create
URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/payments.<format>@  
Method: @POST@  
Required Parameters: XML or JSON data, as specified by the input attributes  
Response: The created payment

Here is a sample JSON document that you might @POST@ to @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/payments.json@ to create an external payment:

<pre><code>
{
  "payment": {
    "amount": 10.00,
    "memo": "Client x paid with $10.00 of nickles"
  }
}
</code></pre>

or if you wish to work in cents the amount_in_cents field can be used:

<pre><code>
{
  "payment": {
    "amount_in_cents": 1000,
    "memo": "Client x paid with $10.00 of pennies"
  }
}
</code></pre>

Here is a sample of a JSON response:

<pre><code>
{
  "payment": {
     "amount_in_cents": 10000,
     "created_at": "2013-08-05T23:14:00-04:00",
