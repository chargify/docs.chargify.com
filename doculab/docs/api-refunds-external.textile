h3. External Refunds

Use this endpoint to record refunds done outside of Chargify, such as directly at the gateway or by sending a check to the subscriber.

* @amount@ The amount represented as a string with two decimal places, for example @14.50@.
* @amount_in_cents@ The amount represented as a string in cents.  For example if the refund was for $14.50, you would pass @1450@
* @memo@ A description of why the refund occured

Note that external refunds will reduce revenue, but they do not affect the balance due for the subscription.
