Chargify Statements give you and your customers a breakdown of Subscription charges, payments, credits, and activity on a period-by-period basis.  A Statement is similar to an "Invoice" because it is marked as currently paid or unpaid.  Statements display all account activity for a specific usage period.

All of the statement attribute fields are returned from GET (read) operations. Note, all of these attributes are *read only*.
