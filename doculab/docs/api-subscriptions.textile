h2. Subscription Input Attributes

When creating a subscription, you must specify a product and a customer.  Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the Product being subscribed (see "Product Options":/product-options).

The product may be specified by @product_id@ or by @product_handle@ (API Handle).

An existing customer may be specified by a @customer_id@ (ID within Chargify) or a @customer_reference@ (unique value within your app that you have shared with Chargify via the @reference@ attribute on a customer).  A new customer may be created by providing @customer_attributes@.

* @product_handle@ The API Handle of the product for which you are creating a subscription. Required, unless a product_id is given instead.
* @product_id@ The Product ID of the product for which you are creating a subscription. The product ID is not currently published, so we recommend using the API Handle instead.
* @customer_id@ The ID of an existing customer within Chargify.  Required, unless a customer_reference or a set of customer_attributes is given.
* @customer_reference@ The reference value (provided by your app) of an existing customer within Chargify.  Required, unless a customer_id or a set of customer_attributes is given.
* @customer_attributes@
** @first_name@ The first name of the customer.  Required when creating a customer via attributes.

If the card or customer does not exist already, or if you want to use a new (unstored) card for the subscription, use @payment_profile_attributes@ *instead* to create a new payment profile along with the subscription.  (This value is available on an existing subscription via the API as @credit_card@ > @id@)
* @payment_profile_attributes@ (this may also be referred to as @credit_card_attributes@)
** @first_name@ (Optional) First name on card.  If omitted, the @first_name@ from customer attributes will be used.
** @last_name@ (Optional) Last name on card.  If omitted, the @last_name@ from customer attributes will be used.
** @full_number@ The full credit card number (string representation, i.e. "5424000000000015")
** @expiration_month@ (Optional when performing a Subscription Import via `vault_token`, required otherwise) The 1- or 2-digit credit card expiration month, as an integer or string, i.e. "5"
** @expiration_year@ (Optional when performing a Subscription Import via `vault_token`, required otherwise) The 4-digit credit card expiration year, as an integer or string, i.e. "2012"

** @billing_zip@ (Optional, may be required by your product configuration or gateway settings) The credit card billing address zip code (i.e. "12345"). _This value is merely passed through to the payment gateway_.
** @billing_country@ (Optional, may be required by your product configuration or gateway settings) The credit card billing address country, preferably in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) format (i.e. "US"). _This value is merely passed through to the payment gateway. Some gateways require country codes in a specific format. Please check your gateway's documentation._
** @vault_token@ (Optional, used only for Subscription Import) The "token" provided by your vault storage for an already stored payment profile

** @card_type@  (Optional, used only for Subscription Import) If you know the card type (i.e. Visa, MC, etc) you may supply it here so that we may display the card type in the UI. May be visa, master, discover, american_express, diners_club, jcb, switch, solo, dankort, maestro, forbrugsforeningen, orlaser`
* @cancellation_message@ (Optional) Can be used when canceling a subscription (via the HTTP DELETE method) to make a note about the reason for cancellation.
* @next_billing_at@ (Optional, used for Subscription Import) Set this attribute to a future date/time to sync imported subscriptions to your existing renewal schedule. See the notes on "Date/Time Format" below. If you provide a next_billing_at timestamp that is in the future, no trial or initial charges will be applied when you create the subscription. In fact, no payment will be captured at all. The first payment will be captured, according to the prices defined by the product, near the time specified by next_billing_at. If you do not provide a value for next_billing_at, any trial and/or initial charges will be assessed and charged at the time of subscription creation. If the card cannot be successfully charged, the subscription will not be created.
* @vat_number@ (Optional) Supplying the VAT number allows EU customers to opt-out of the Value Added Tax assuming the merchant address and customer billing address are not within the same EU country.


h2. Subscription Output Attributes

The following attributes are returned on a subscription read/list operation.

h2. Methods

_format_ may be either 'xml' or 'json'.

h3. List

Listing subscriptions is paginated, 20 at a time by default with an allowed max of 200 per page.  They are listed most recently created first.

You may control pagination using the @page@ and/or @per_page@ parameters.

URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions.<format>@  
Method: @GET@  
Optional Parameters:
@page@: an integer value which specifies which page of results to fetch, starting at 1.  Fetching successively higher page numbers will return additional results, until there are no more results to return (in which case an empty result set will be returned).  Defaults to 1.
@per_page@: how many records to fetch in each request, defaults to 20.  The maximum allowed is 200 - any @per_page@ value over 200 will be changed to 200.
Response: An array of Subscriptions  
**Usage Examples:**  
"XML example":#api-usage-xml-subscriptions-list  
"JSON example":#api-usage-json-subscriptions-list

Response: The created subscription  
**Usage Examples:**  
"XML example":#api-usage-xml-subscriptions-create  
"JSON example":#api-usage-json-subscriptions-create  

h3. Importing Subscriptions

Subscriptions can be "imported" via the API to handle the following scenarios:

* You already have existing subscriptions with specific renewal dates that you would like to import to Chargify
* You already have credit cards stored in your provider's vault and you would like to create subscriptions using those tokens

Before importing, you should have already set up your products to match your offerings.  Then, you can create Subscriptions via the API just like you normally would, but using a few special attributes.

The following _additions_ to the subscription input attributes make imports possible.

* @next_billing_at@: set this attribute to a future date/time to sync imported subscriptions to your existing renewal schedule.  See the notes on "Date/Time Format" below.  If you provide a @next_billing_at@ timestamp that is in the future, no trial or initial charges will be applied when you create the subscription.  In fact, no payment will be captured at all.  The first payment will be captured, according to the prices defined by the product, near the time specified by @next_billing_at@.  If you do not provide a value for @next_billing_at@, any trial and/or initial charges will be assessed and charged at the time of subscription creation.  If the card cannot be successfully charged, the subscription will not be created.
* @payment_profile_attributes@
  * @vault_token@: the "token" provided by your vault storage for an already stored payment profile
  * @customer_vault_token@ (only for Authorize.Net CIM storage): the @customerProfileId@ for the owner of the @customerPaymentProfileId@ provided as the @vault_token@
  * @current_vault@: the vault that stores the payment profile with the provided @vault_token@.  May be @authorizenet@, @trust_commerce@, @payment_express@, @beanstream@, or @braintree1@
  * @last_four@ (optional): If you have the last 4 digits of the credit card number, you may supply them here so that we may create a masked card number (i.e. 'XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234') for display in the UI
  * @card_type@ (optional): If you know the card type (i.e. Visa, MC, etc) you may supply it here so that we may display the card type in the UI.  May be @visa@, @master@, @discover@, @american_express@, @diners_club@, @jcb@, @switch@, @solo@, @dankort@, @maestro@, @forbrugsforeningen, or @laser@

*Note:* @payment_profile_attributes@ is the same thing as @credit_card_attributes@ used elsewhere in the documentation.  The two keys are interchangeable, pick one to use but not both.  Most new documentation will refer to @payment_profile_attributes@

h4. Date/Time formats

We will attempt to parse any string you send as the value of @next_billing_at@ in to a date or time.  For best results, use a known format like described in ["Date and Time Specification" of RFC 2822](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.3) or [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

The following are all equivalent and will work as input to @next_billing_at@:

@Aug 06 11:34:00 -0400 2010@  
@Aug 06 11:34 -0400 2010@  
@2010-08-06T11:34:00-04:00@  
@8/6/2010 11:34:00 EDT@  
@8/6/2010 8:34:00 PDT@  
@2010-08-06T15:34:00Z@  

You may also pass just a date, in which case we will assume the time to be midnight

@2010-08-06@

h4. Full Example

Here is a sample JSON document that you might @POST@ to @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscription.json@ to import a subscription:

<pre><code>
{
  "product_handle":"basic",
  "next_billing_at":"2010-08-29T12:00:00-04:00",
  "customer_attributes":{
    "first_name":"John",
    "last_name":"Doe",
    "email":"john.doe@example.com",
    "reference":"123",
    "organization":"Acme Widgets"
  },
  "payment_profile_attributes":{
    "vault_token":"12345",
    "customer_vault_token":"67890",
    "current_vault":"authorizenet",
    "expiration_year":"2020",
    "expiration_month":"12",
    "card_type":"visa",
    "last_four":"1111"
  }
}
</code></pre>
    
h3(#update). Update

The update action currently allows you to edit the attributes of the customer, payment profile (credit card), or subscribed product (although no proration or reset options are offered at this time).

This is how you would change the card that somebody uses for their subscription.  You can also use this method to simply change the expiration date of the card.

You also use this method to change the subscription to a different product by setting a new value for @product_handle@.  Note that no proration or period reset is initiated when you change the product using this method.  This method merely changes the product, and *the new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period*.  If you desire prorated upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the "docs on upgrades/downgrades":/upgrades-downgrades.

URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions/<subscription_id>.<format>@  
Method: @PUT@  
Required Parameters: None
Optional Parameters: XML or JSON data with updated values for @customer_attributes@ or @credit_card_attributes@
Response: The updated subscription  
**Usage Examples:**  
"XML example":#api-usage-xml-subscriptions-update  
"JSON example":#api-usage-json-subscriptions-update  


h3(#cancel). Delete/Cancel

The delete action causes the cancellation of a subscription, i.e. it sets the subscription state to @canceled@.

URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions/<subscription_id>.<format>@  
Method: @DELETE@  
Required Parameters: None
Optional Parameters: XML or JSON data with a @cancellation_message@ note that will be stored with the subscription.
Response: 200 OK on success
**Usage Examples:**  
"XML example":#api-usage-xml-subscriptions-delete  
"JSON example":#api-usage-json-subscriptions-delete  

h3(#delayed). Delayed Cancel

Chargify offers the ability to cancel a subscription at the end of the current period (as set by its current product. Setting the subscription to cancel at the end of the period sets the @cancel_at_end_of_period@ to @true@. Note, that you cannot set @cancel_at_end_of_period@ at subscription creation.

URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions/<subscription_id>.<format>@  
Method: @PUT@  
Required Parameters: None
Optional Parameters: XML or JSON data with @cancel_at_end_of_period@ set to true or false.
Response: The updated subscription
**Usage Examples:**  
"XML example":#api-usage-xml-subscriptions-delayed-cancel  
"JSON example":#api-usage-json-subscriptions-delayed-cancel

h3. Reactivate

Chargify offers the ability to reactivate a previously canceled subscription. For details on how reactivation works, and how to reactivate subscriptions through the Admin Interface, see "Reactivation":reactivation

URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/reactivate.xml@
Method: @PUT@
Required Parameters: none
Optional Parameters: @include_trial@ - Boolean, default 0. If 1 is sent the reactivated subscription will include a trial if one is available. If 0 is sent, the trial period will be ignored.  This parameter should be sent in a query string, and does not need to be nested inside a @subscription@ object
Response: The updated subscription  

"XML example":#api-react-xml
"JSON example":#api-react-json

h3. Reset Balance

Chargify offers the ability to easily reset the balance of a subscription to zero. If a subscription has a positive balance, this API call will issue a credit to the subscription for the outstanding balance. This is particularly helpful if you want to reactivate a canceled subscription without charging the customer for their previously owed balance. 

URL: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/reset_balance.xml@
Method: PUT
Required Parameters: none
Response: The updated subscription

**Usage Examples:**  
"XML example":#api-reset-balance-xml 
"JSON example":#api-reset-balance-json
