h2. Transaction Types

The following is a list of available transaction types

|_. Type |_. Description |_. Effect on Subscriber Balance Due |_. Effect on "Revenue" (money collected) |
| @charge@ | A positive amount assessed to a subscription for an item (i.e. a Product or Component) sale.  Usually assessed at signup or renewal time. | Increases balance due | No effect on revenue |
| @credit@ | A negative amount assessed to a subscription that indicates a "return" or "credit" for an item (i.e. a Product or Component). Usually offsets an earlier charge, i.e. in the case of a prorated downgrade. | Decreases balance due | No effect on revenue |
| @adjustment@ | A postive or negative amount that adjusts the subscription balance but cannot usually be directly attributed to a single item (Product or Component) | Increases or decreases balance due | No effect on revenue |
| @payment@ | A postive amount that denotes amount paid to you by the subscriber, usually on their credit card or bank account via your payment gateway.  Payments may also be recorded "manually" in the case of checks received, or money received outside of Chargify. | Decreases balance due | Increases revenue |
| @refund@ | A positive amount that denotes "cash" given back to a subscriber (i.e. put back on their card) via a refund or credit at the gateway. | No effect on balance due | Decreases revenue |
| @info_transaction@ | An informational transaction whose description provides context for transactions nearby in time, or serves as a placeholder for another transaction that could not be attempted (i.e. when payment cannot be attempted because no card is on file) | N/A | N/A |
| @payment_authorization@ | Deprecated. No longer appears in transactions listing | N/A | N/A |

  In order to integrate my app with Chargify
  As a developer
  I want to read/show a transaction via the Chargify JSON API

  Background:
    Given I am a valid API user
    And I send and accept JSON
    And I have 1 product
    And I have 1 active subscriptions

  Scenario: Retrieve a transaction via ID
    Given I have a transaction
    When I send a GET request to https://[@subdomain].chargify.com/transactions/[@transaction.id].json
    Then the response status should be "200 OK"
    And the response should be the json:
      """
      {
        "transaction":{
          "transaction_type":"payment",
          "created_at":`auto generated`,
          "product_id":[@product.id],
          "starting_balance_in_cents": `auto generated`,
          "ending_balance_in_cents":null,
          "memo":null,
          "id":[@transaction.id],
          "type":"Payment",
          "amount_in_cents":1000,
          "success":true,
          "subscription_id":[@subscription.id],
          "payment_id":null
        }
      }
      """

  @allow-rescue
  Scenario: Attempt to retrieve a transaction that doesn't exist
    Given no transactions exist
    When I send a GET request to https://[@subdomain].chargify.com/transactions/9999.json
    Then the response status should be "404 Not Found"
