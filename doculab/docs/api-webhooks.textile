The Webhooks API allows you to view a list of all webhooks and to selectively resend individual or groups of webhooks.

h2. URIs

|_. Resource/URI |_. GET |_. POST |_. PUT |_. DELETE |
| @/webhooks@ | List webhooks | - | - | - |
| @/webhooks/replay@ | - | Resend webhooks | -  | - |

h2. Webhook Attributes

* @id@ The unique identifier for the webhooks (unique across all of Chargify).  This is not changed on a retry/replay of the same webhook, so it may be used to avoid duplicate action for the same event.
* @successful@ A boolean flag describing whether the webhook was accepted by the webhook endpoint *for the most recent attempt*. (Acceptance is defined by receiving a "200 OK" HTTP response within a reasonable timeframe, i.e. 15 seconds)
* @event@ A string describing which event type produced the given Webhook
* @body@ The data sent within the Webhook post
* @signature@ The calculated Webhook signature
* @signature_hmac_sha_256@ The calculated HMAC-SHA-256 Webhook signature
* @created_at@ Timestamp indicating when the Webhook was created
* @accepted_at@ Timestamp indicating when the Webhook was accepted by the merchant endpoint.  When a webhook is explicitly replayed by the merchant, this value will be cleared until it is accepted again.
* @last_sent_at@ Timestamp indicating when the most recent attempt was made to send the Webhook
* @last_error_at@ Timestamp indicating when the last non-acceptance occurred.  If a webhooks is later resent and accepted, this field will be cleared.
* @last_sent_url@ The url that the endpoint was last sent to.
* @last_error@ Text describing the status code and/or error from the last failed attempt to send the Webhook.  When a webhook is retried and accepted, this field will be cleared.
