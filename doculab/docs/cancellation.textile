A canceled Subscription is no longer billed by Chargify.  There are two ways a Subscription can be canceled:

# Explicitly requesting cancellation via the UI or API
# After a period of time (defined by your "Dunning":/dunning plan) passes with no payment for an overdue balance

h2. Requesting Cancellation

h3(#admin-ui). Via the Admin UI

You can request cancellation of a Subscription yourself by clicking "Initiate Cancelation" from the Actions menu.

After clicking "Initiate Cancelation", you will have the opportunity to enter a message about the cancellation and review the action before either pressing the "Cancel Immediately" button, or the "Cancel at End of Period" button.

When you cancel a Subscription:

* You have the option of canceling immediately or at the end of the period, selecting either option means the customer's credit card will no longer be charged.
* When canceling at the end of the period, the subscription will cease to renew automatically at the "Period Ends At" date and the subscription state will change.
* No refunds or prorations are made
* No email is sent to your Customer

You can later "Reactivate":/reactivation a canceled Subscription.

h3(#api). Via the API

See the "Delete/Cancel method in the Subscriptions API":/api-subscriptions#cancel.

h2(#dunning). Automatic Cancellation due to Dunning

After a failed payment, Subscriptions transition to the Past Due state within Chargify.  At this point, Chargify begins attempting to re-run the payment on a smart schedule.  Eventually, we cease retrying to re-run the payment, and some of the Dunning strategies will automatically move the Subscription to Canceled state. See the "Dunning documentation":/dunning for how to control this automatic cancellation.
