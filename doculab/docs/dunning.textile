Dunning is the process of how you handle past due accounts.  It involves communicating with your customers in response to failed credit card transactions, and what action you take when the subscription can't be renewed. Chargify gives you the ability to customize these communications.

h2. Configuring your Dunning

Dunning is configured from the "Retries and Dunning" section of the "Settings" tab as shown below.

!/images/doculab/retries-and-dunning-settings.png!

Configuration is managed in separate sections: "*Retries and Final Action*":#dunning-retries and "*Dunning Emails*":#dunning-emails.

h3(#dunning-retries). Retries and Final Action

When a subscription's period ends, the normal renewal process attempts to charge the card on file.  If that attempt results in a failure (i.e. a processor "decline"), the subscription becomes "past due".  **That renewal attempt is renewal attempt #1**.  Chargify will automatically retry the failed charge, currently approximately every 24 hours, up to the number of attempts you configure in this section.  At the end of this "retry period", you can take a "final action" on the subscription and optionally send an email.

p(note). To send periodic "reminder" emails during the retry period, see the next section on "Dunning Emails":#dunning-emails.

In the "Retries and Final Action" section, the grey boxes indicate items you can change about how often to retry and what action to take.

Clicking any of the grey boxes will open a window where you can edit your retry settings:

Select *how many retries* you would like Chargify to perform before you take a "Final Action".  Entering "1" in this box will cause the Final Action to be taken upon the very first failed attempt to renew, i.e. no retries will take place.

Next select *the Final Action to take*.  You can either *cancel the subscription* or *mark the subscription unpaid*

* When you *cancel the subscription*, the subscription will transition to the "'canceled' state":/subscription-states#canceled and it will cease to accrue any new charges.  No more attempts will be made to collect the balance due.  A canceled subscription can be later "Reactivated":/reactivation.
* When you *mark the subscription unpaid*, the subscription will transition to the "'unpaid' state":/subscription-states#unpaid, but it will continue to accrue new charges.  No more attempts will be made to collect the balance due.  An unpaid subscription can be moved back to active by either applying a payment, retrying the renewal (and receiving a successful payment), or zeroing out the balance and retrying the renewal.

Finally, you may *optionally specify an email* to be sent upon the execution of the Final Action.  Enter your Subject and Body, and choose whether or not to be BCC'd on this email.  This email has access to custom parameters as defined in the section below on "Customizing Dunning Emails":#customizing-dunning-emails.

h3(#dunning-emails). Dunning Emails

During the retry period (that you define in the "Retry and Final Action":#dunning-retries section), you can choose to send periodic "reminder" emails to the customer of the past due subscription.

In the section marked "Dunning", you can configure your "From Address" for the Dunning Emails, add a new Dunning Email, or edit an existing Dunning Email:

!/images/doculab/dunning-email-list.png!

p(note). The "From Address" configured in this section will also be used as the "From Address" on your Final Action email.  It defaults to your merchant email address.

When adding or editing a new Dunning Email, you will be able to edit the Subject and Body, and choose whether or not to be BCC'd on this email.  This email has access to custom parameters as defined in the section below on "Customizing Dunning Emails":#customizing-dunning-emails.

!/images/doculab/dunning-email-edit-window.png!

h2(#customizing-dunning-emails). Customizing your Dunning Emails

When editing your Final Action Email and Dunning Emails, you can use keywords that Chargify will replace dynamically before sending the email. Custom parameters are surrounded in double curly braces like this:  {{custom_parameter}}.
