p(note). If you need an introduction to the purpose and function of Gateways and Merchant Accounts, or need help obtaining one, please see our "FAQ on Basic Payment Gateway Requirements":http://support.chargify.com/faqs/getting-started/payment-gateway-requirements

By default, your Site will be set to use the Chargify Test Gateway.  The Test Gateway is great for playing around, but in order to test your integration with a sandbox gateway, or to sell subscriptions using a real gateway, you will need to choose a gateway and enter your credentials.

h3. The Chargify Test Gateway

This gateway does not do any real authorizations or captures on credit cards.  It allows you to simulate successful and unsuccessful credit card transactions.

When using the Chargify Test Gateway:

* Use the credit card number "1" to simulate a credit card in good status. All payments and authorizations will succeed.
* Use the credit card number "2" to simulate a credit card that will not accept any payments. Authorizations will succeed.
* Use the credit card number "3" to simulate a credit card in which all authorizations and payments will fail.

h3. Sites in _test_ mode connect to "Sandbox" gateways

Any Site that is in test mode will only work with gateways accounts that are provided as test, developer, or sandbox accounts from your gateway provider.  Usually, these "test" gateways use a different URL than their production counterparts, and Sites that are in test mode will only connect to these URLs.

<!-- TODO: create a list of links to resources for getting test gateway accounts with each of our supported gateways -->

h3. Sites in _production_ mode connect to "Live" gateways

Any Site that is in production mode will only work with real, live gateway accounts.  If you are experiencing problems with incorrect credentials, ensure that you don't have a mismatch between your Chargify Site mode (test vs. production) and your type of gateway (test vs. live)

h2. Selecting or Changing your Payment Gateway

You may only change gateways if the Site has *no live subscriptions*.  If you need to change gateways, you may either create another Site, or cancel all of the subscriptions within your Site.  If you are working with a test site, you may also consider "clearing your Site data":/clearing-site-data for a quick way to "reset" your Site and change gateways.

h2. Setting up or Changing your Payment Gateway

To set up your gateway and credentials, start by selecting the site you want to modify.

Next, click the Settings tab.

Click "Use this Gateway" next to the name of your gateway provider. Some providers may be disabled if they do not support the Site's selected currency or if the site already has subscriptions.

Finally, enter your gateway credentials. All fields are required. The credentials requested for your gateway should be provided by your gateway, either via email or in their administrative interface. Be sure that you are entering your test credentials for a test site or live credentials for a production site.
