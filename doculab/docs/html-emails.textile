HTML Emails allow you to send HTML part Emails to your customers. This provides the opportunity to brand the messages that are sent out on your behalf to your customers based on Chargify events.  We currently support the following emails in the HTML Email Editor: Signup, Receipt, Card Expiration, End of Trial, and Upcoming Renewal emails. Dunning emails cannot be stylized.

h3. What is needed?

To properly stylize branded emails you will need a good understanding of HTML. We also now support Markdown in the email body to provide an easy mechanism for producing nice looking content (HTML is supported as well).

h3. Terminology

+Layout+: Refers to the container for the email that will be sent. This is where you will define
your CSS styles and produce the structure of your emails.

+Template+:  This is the body of the email that will be sent out. This has the main content of the email and there is one per event that is described above. You can set the Layout, From, and Subject.

+Note+: All existing emails will continue to send as they did until you use the new HTML Email Editor.

h3. Steps

1) Go to the Site Settings page and click the "Emails" tab, find the email template that you wish to edit and click "Edit Template".

2) Create a new Layout by clicking on the Plus Sign next to the Layout drop-down.

+Note+: Layouts can be applied to each email so you only have to create one layout if you wish to. Or you can have have a layout per email if you wish.

3) Define your layout in the editor with desired HTML layout. You will notice that there is a tag "{{main_content}}" this is required it is where the template will be rendered. The layout will live update as you are editing so it gives you a way of previewing it (after it is saved the first time).

4) Save the Layout and and now you should be able to use it for your templates. To get back to editing the Template click on the "< Email" link in the top left hand corner of the editor.

5) Select the Layout from the Layouts drop-down and click the "Save" button. You should now see your template rendered inside of your layout! Yay!

+Note+: If you don't like the look of the layout you may edit it at any time by selecting it from the Layouts drop-down and clicking the pencil icon.

6) Now it is time to edit your Template this is the same as it always has been with the support of liquid fields ("more info here":/email-templates). While editing templates if you wait a second or two after you stop typing you notice that the preview pane on the right hand side will update.
+Note+: this will not apply to emails that are being sent until you click "Save".

h3. One last thing

We have also added a mechanism for previewing and changing example fields for the emails so that you can define your conditions and preview what it will look like before you send it. You can find the example fields in the left hand corner of the preview pane.

+Note+: The defined fields in the editor are only for previewing purposes and will _*not*_ be used when sending the email. It is also possible to produce scenarios that are not possible in the Chargify system.
