h3. Chargify Documentation has moved.

The API documentation remains here, but all basic product information, guides, tutorials, etc are now available on our new "Help Center":https://help.chargify.com

h3. API Integration

Chargify can be integrated with many environments and programming languages via our REST API.  Some of our users have contributed their API Wrappers in various programming languages.  Check out the "API Code Overview":/api-code doc for an introduction to the wrappers and available code samples.

Check out the list of "Chargify Consultants":http://chargify.com/consultants if you require deeper technical expertise for your integration.

We always enjoy (and appreciate) hearing about larger integrations ahead of time.  If you're planning on importing a large amount of data into Chargify via our API, we suggest sending a "heads up" to "support@chargify.com" so we can coordinate with you to ensure your import process goes smoothly.

Our API, while considered stable, is continually being improved and polished.  Please feel free to contact support if you experience issues when integrating with the Chargify API.

h4(#api-support). API Support

Access to our Tier 2 team for API support is currently only available to customers on our Basic ($149) plan or above given the cost of providing that level of support.

But don't worry! There are quite a few options to help you get the answers you need:

Upgrade to the Small Business plan: "Log into Chargify":https://app.chargify.com/ and click "Home" -> "Billing & Plans" -> "Change"

"Read through our helpful API documentation":https://docs.chargify.com/api-introduction

"Watch our videos and tutorials on YouTube":https://www.youtube.com/user/chargify

"Check out the Chargify tag on Stack Overflow":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chargify

"Refer to our trusted Integration Consultants":https://www.chargify.com/consultants/

h4. Developer Support

If you are on the Developer (free) plan, please note that we do offer limited API support. Your ticket will be given a low priority and will receive a response within 48 hours. **All paid merchants receive priority support.**  We make this distinction to ensure that our paying customers receive the appropriate time and attention they deserve to run their business.
