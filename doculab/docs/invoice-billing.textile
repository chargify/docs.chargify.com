Chargify supports two Payment Collection methods: Automatic and Invoice Billing. By default, Chargify uses automatic billing to bill your customer's credit card every pay period.

Invoice Billing allows you to bill your customers manually by sending them an invoice each month. Subscriptions with invoice billing enabled will not be charged automatically.

h2. Configuring Invoice Billing

Invoice billing is turned on in the settings tab. The default option determines which payment collection method is used when customers sign up via the hosted pages. The collection method can be set to either option when creating a subscription in the Admin UI or via the API.

In addition, You can set Payment Terms and Notes that will appear on the invoice. Finally, you can toggle whether or or not Invoices are emailed to customers automatically.

h2. Creating an Invoice Billing subscription in the Admin UI

Once invoice billing has been enabled, you can select the payment collection method when creating a subscription in the admin ui. The collection method will default to the option set in the site settings. Payment Collection Method does not appear if invoice billing is turned off.

h2. Viewing Invoices

When invoice billing is turned on, an Invoices tab appears under the top level Subscriptions tab. This allows you to view a list of all invoices. Invoices can be searched by number, customer and invoice state.

You may navigate between invoices using the "Next" and "Prev" links at the top of the invoice.

h2. Invoice States

Invoices are always in one of the following states:

* unpaid
* partial
* paid
* archived

h4. unpaid

Unless no payment is due when the invoice is created, an invoice begins it's life in the unpaid state.

h4. partial

An invoice is in the partial state when a partial payment has been made but there is still an outstanding balance.

h4. paid

An invoice is in the paid state when a the entire balance has been paid.

h4. archived

An invoice can be archived at any point in it's lifecycle. You can use this state to simply disregard or ignore a previously created invoice.

h2. Applying Payments, Charges, Credits

Once an invoice has been created, you can add payments, credits and additional charges to the invoice.

To apply a payment to an invoice, navigate to the list of invoices and select 'Enter Payment' from the options menu.

h2. Dunning

Chargify does not currently enforce dunning strategies on Invoice Billing subscriptions. The subscription will remain active even when an invoice has been unpaid for an extended period of time.

h2. Emailing Invoices to your Customers

h3. On-Demand

You may email any Invoice to the Customer at any time by using the button near bottom of the Invoice view.  There are also links for viewing the invoice as Text, HTML, or PDF.  Chargify sends all Invoice emails as multi-part with both text/plain and text/html parts so that the client may choose which to render.  You can also choose to send a PDF attachment as well in the "Invoice Billing" section of Settings.

h3. Automatic Invoices

Invoices can be sent to your customers automatically via email.  When you choose to send Invoices automatically, they will always be sent when a new invoice is created.

Please note that statement emails are not sent to customers that have invoice billing enabled.
