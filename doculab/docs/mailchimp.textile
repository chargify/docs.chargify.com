Our MailChimp integration will automatically sync Chargify customers to a MailChimp list.

h2. Availability

The MailChimp integration is available to merchants:

* On the free Developer plan (for testing), OR

Use the drop-down to select one of your MailChimp lists.  Remember that this needs to be a new, empty list.

When you're ready, click the "Continue to Final Setup" button.

h4. Start Exporting

Click the "Start Exporting" button to begin the process.

h2. How it Works

Once you click the "Start Exporting" button, Chargify will sync the

* customer ID
* customer email address
* customer first name
* customer last name
* customer reference
* product name
* subscription state

of all of the customers in your Chargify Site to the MailChimp list you selected.

Going forward, we will sync changes when a customer is updated, a new subscription is added, or a subscription is changed.

h2. Making Changes

Once the MailChimp integration is enabled, you have the option to disable it in order to make changes, or to completely start over.
Remember, if you start over, you need to create a new MailChimp list.

h2. FAQ

h3. What if more than one Chargify customer has the same email address?

If more than one customer in Chargify has the same email address, we will create a single record in MailChimp that contains comma-delimited lists of the related customer IDs, product names, and subscription states.
