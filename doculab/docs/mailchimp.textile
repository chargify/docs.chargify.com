Our MailChimp integration will automatically sync Chargify customers to a MailChimp list.

**This integration is currently in beta status**.  "What does it mean for a Chargify feature to be beta?":/beta-label

h2. Availability

The MailChimp integration is available to merchants:

* On the free Developer plan (for testing), OR
* On the Small Business Plus plan or higher

If you would like to test out the integration during the beta period, but you do not meet these criteria, you may "open a support ticket":https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new and request a one month credit for a free upgrade to the Small Business Plus plan.

h2. Configuring the Integration

The MailChimp integration tab is found within the main Integrations tab on each of your Sites:

You should see the "Everything's Chimpy!" message appear below your key.

Once that's done, click the "Continue to List Configuration" button.

h4. Choose List

Next you will need to choose which MailChimp list to sync to.

Use the drop-down to select one of your MailChimp lists.  Remember that this needs to be a new, empty list.

Note that the integration only supports connecting to one of the 25 most recently created lists.  Other lists will not appear in the drop-down.

When you're ready, click the "Continue to Final Setup" button.

h4. Start Exporting

Click the "Start Exporting" button to begin the process.

h2. How it Works

Once you click the "Start Exporting" button, Chargify will sync the

* customer ID
* customer email address
* customer first name
* customer last name
* customer reference
* product name
* subscription state

of all of the customers in your Chargify Site to the MailChimp list you selected.

Going forward, we will sync changes when a customer is updated, a new subscription is added, or a subscription is changed.

h2. Making Changes

Once the MailChimp integration is enabled, you have the option to disable it in order to make changes, or to completely start over.
Remember, if you start over, you need to create a new MailChimp list.

h2. FAQ

h3. What if more than one Chargify customer has the same email address?

If more than one customer in Chargify has the same email address, we will create a single record in MailChimp that contains comma-delimited lists of the related customer IDs, product names, and subscription states.
