When filling out the password, there will be a feedback indicator under the password field that indicates whether the password is strong enough or not. When the indicator is green (showing 'Strong' or 'Great') the password should be accepted.

Please note that there are some things that can cause it to fail such as:

* Uses common dictionary words, even if letters are replaced with numbers/characters. e.g. “p@s$W0RD”.
* Includes part of the username/email/company name in the password, even if the letters are replaced as mentioned above.
