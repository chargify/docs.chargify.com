In Chargify, you sell Subscriptions to your Products.  You must first create and configure a Product before you can sell anything to a Customer.  Products are administered on a Site-by-Site basis, on the main "Products" tab.

In your app or business, you might call these Products your "Plans" or "Feature Levels".  For example, if you have "Basic", "Pro", and "Max" plans, each of these would be a separate Product within Chargify.

h3. Product Families

Products belong to a "*Product Family*":/product-families.  Product Families should contain the Products that are all different "feature levels" of the same thing - i.e. you can usually upgrade and downgrade between Products within the same Product Family, *but not between Products in different Families*.  The "Product Family documentation":/product-families goes in to more depth on how to structure your Product Family and Product relationships.

h3. Creating a Product

Once you have created a Product Family, you will have access to the "Create a Product" link next to the Product Family name.

Some of the basic parameters of a Product are:

* *Name*
* *Description*
* *Accounting Code*
* "*Product Options*":/product-options such as Return URL and Parameters, API handle, Credit Card requirements, and Address requirements
* "*Product Pricing*":/product-pricing allows you to set the recurring interval, recurring price, trial period, trial price, initial fees, and expiration intervals

p(note). *Why do we call them "Products", and not "Plans"?** Chargify makes it easy to sell other things that are not plan-based, such as Sponsorships.  Often, these things might belong to separate Product Families along side your normal recurring service offerings.  "Plans" just seemed too restrictive.  Just think of it this way: If your customers can pay for it, its a Product.  If they can upgrade/downgrade to another Product, then those Products are part of the same Product Family.*
