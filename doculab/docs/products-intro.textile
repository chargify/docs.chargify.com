In Chargify, you sell Subscriptions to your Products.  You must first create and configure a Product before you can sell anything to a Customer.  Products are administered on a Site-by-Site basis, on the main "Products" tab.

In your app or business, you might call these Products your "Plans" or "Feature Levels".  For example, if you have "Basic", "Pro", and "Max" plans, each of these would be a separate Product within Chargify.

Some of the basic parameters of a Product are:

* *Name*
* *Description*
* *Accounting Code*
* "*Product Options*":/product-options such as Return URL and Parameters, API handle, Credit Card requirements, and Address requirements
* "*Product Pricing*":/product-pricing allows you to set the recurring interval, recurring price, trial period, trial price, initial fees, and expiration intervals

h4. Archiving Products

Deleting products isn't supported, but what is supported is archiving products. Archiving products removes the ability for new subscriptions to be created with that product (either by signup or migration). However, existing subscriptions will continue normally against their archived product unless moved via product change or migration away from it.

p(note). *Why do we call them "Products", and not "Plans"?** Chargify makes it easy to sell other things that are not plan-based, such as Sponsorships. "Plans" just seemed too restrictive.
