h2. Overview

Chargify has its own referrals system integrated right into the product. Chargify generates a referral code for each of your subscriptions and rewards the new customer, as well as the referrer, when a new signup is created with the code.

h2(#availability). Availability

The Referrals feature is available to merchants:

* On the free Developer plan (for testing), OR
* On the Basic plan or higher

h2(#configuration). Configuration

# Begin by navigating to Setup > Referrals

# Define the 'One-Time Credit for the Referring Customer'. This is the discount that will be given to the subscription whose referral code was used.
# Define the 'Coupon Discount for the New Customer'. This is the discount that anyone signing up with a referral code will receive. The discount works exactly like our existing coupon functionality.
# Once your settings are saved, click the 'Enable Referrals' button on Setup > Referrals.

h2(#flow-api). How To Obtain Referral Codes

Once referrals have been enabled, a unique referral code will be created for every subscription. You can obtain the referral code by visiting the subscription summary page for the subscription, or by "fetching the subscription from the API":https://docs.chargify.com/api-subscriptions#read.

h3(#email). Using Referral Codes in Email Templates

Referral codes can also be inserted into the emails that Chargify sends to your customers by using the @subscription.referral_code@ field.

For example, in the Signup Email, you might want to provide a signup link that your new customer can give out to their friends.  You can do this by appending @?ref=@ and the referral code to the URL of any one of your Public Signup Pages:

@https://acme.chargify.com/subscribe/npvmy9bn/basic?ref={{subscription.referral_code}}@

Alternately, you may want to append the referral code to a URL on your own site, and then pass it back to Chargify after the customer selects which product they would like to subscribe to.

h2(#flow). Referral Signup Flow via URL Parameter (Public Pages)

1. A user navigates to a Public Signup Page with a referral code in the URL. For example: @http://acme.chargify.com/subscribe/5p3wn7w7/basic?ref=4bn9x5@. The customer is shown a preview of the referral discount that will be applied to their subscription.

Note:  Either a referral code or a coupon code may be used.  If valid codes for both are supplied, the referral discount will be applied and the coupon will be ignored.

2. The new customer completes their signup and the referral discount is applied.

3. A one-time discount is applied to the referring subscription

4. The referral appears in the Referral History in the Admin UI

p(note). Please note that the Referring Subscription must be in the Active status in order for the referral discount and credit to be applied. In addition, an invalid referral code, either in the @ref@ parameter, or entered into the "Referral code" textbox, will fail validation, and the subscription will not be created.

h2(#flow-psp). Referral Signup Flow via Signup Form (Public Pages)

1. For a given public page, enable "Display referrals":
!{width:680px}/images/doculab/display-referrals.png!

1. A user navigates to a Public Signup Page. For example: @http://acme.chargify.com/subscribe/5p3wn7w7/basic@. The customer can enter their referral code and validate it, while seeing preview of the referral discount that will be applied to their subscription.
!{width:680px}/images/doculab/referral-validation.png!

2. The new customer completes their signup and the referral discount is applied; from this point on the behavior is the same as "Referral Signup Flow via URL Parameter":/referrals#flow

p(note). Please note that the Referring Subscription must be in the Active status in order for the referral discount and credit to be applied. In addition, an invalid referral code, either in the @ref@ parameter, or entered into the "Referral code" textbox, will fail validation, and the subscription will not be created.

h2(#flow-api). Referral Signup Flow (API)

The Subscription#create API endpoint now takes an optional @ref@ parameter. "Click here":/api-subscriptions for more details.
