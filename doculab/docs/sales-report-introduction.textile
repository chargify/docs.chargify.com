h2. Selecting What Data To Include

You may view your data "grouped by product" or "itemized".  In either case, you can choose to view "All Products" or specific products or items.

h3. Grouped By Product View

In the "grouped by Product" view, all sales data is tied to the base product that a customer's sale/discount/tax etc. is associated with. For example, if you have two Products ("Pro Plan" and "Basic Plan"), and also have a "Widget" component, the data for the "Widget" component will be broken out between "Pro" and "Basic", depending on which plan each customer was subscribed to at the time of a renewal, payment, etc.

h3. Itemized View

In the "itemized" view, all sales data is totaled for each Product, Component, or "special item":#special-items, regardless of the customer's base product.

h2. Cash vs. Accrual

The Sales Report displays only those sales for which you have been paid - subscriptions in dunning are not included.  After payment, the Cash vs. Accrual toggle controls the timing of the sale and, hence, within which month it will appear.

* Accrual: Sales are displayed in the month in which they were originally billed.
* Cash: Sales are displayed in the month in which they were actually paid.

For example, consider the case where a subscriber renews on January 31st but their card is declined.  Then, they enter a new card which is successfully charged on February 1st.

* Under the accrual method, this sale will be counted in January.
* Under the cash method, this sale will be counted in Febrary.

h2. Sales Report Data Explained

The Sales Report table presents the following data:

* *Sales:* Total sales for the selected products/items in the selected period.

* *Discounts:* Total coupon or referral discounts for the selected products/items in the selected period.

* *Taxes:* Total tax receipts for the selected products/items in the selected period.

* *Adjustments:* Balance adjustments, resets, or credits that offset Sales and change the amount due.  For example, if a subscriber had a $20 balance due and the balance is reset to $0, you would still have $20 in "Sales" but also -$20 in "Adjustments" (i.e. a Credit) for that period. It is possible to have positive adjustments which lead to higher Cash Receipts or Revenue.

* *Cash Receipts:* This is money that has been collected from a credit card automatically, or from an external payment.

* *Deferred Cash Applied:* Cash pre-payments, applied to a later sale.

* *Prepayments:* Cash received above and beyond the sale amount.

* *Revenue:*  Cash Receipts + Deferred Cash Applied - Prepayments - Taxes.  This value provides one kind of calculation for "recognized revenue".

For example, consider a customer subscribed to "Pro Plan", which has a base price of $20/per month. In May, "Pro Plan" renews for $20, and leaves a $20 balance on the subscription. Later in May, a $40 check was recorded as an "external payment". The first $20 of that payment is recorded as Cash and assigned to "Pro Plan". The remaining $20 in recorded as Cash, and is assigned to the Prepayment "special item":#special-items. In June, when "Pro Plan" renews for $20, it will use the $20 left over from the check recorded in May. That revenue will be recorded as "Deferred Cash Applied" for June.

Using the Sales Report, the above situation will then result in $40 of Cash Receipts in May, and $0 of Cash Receipts in June.  However, you would see that you had $20 of Sales (and "Revenue") in both May and June.  Accounting calls this principle "recognizing revenue" - note that you may do revenue recognition differently.

h3(#special-items). Special Items

Special items are "catch-all" psuedo-items that receive sales data that cannot be applied to a particular Product or Component. Sales data on special items contributes to your monthly totals.

* *Other Adjustments:* Captures balance adjustments and cash receipts that cannot be associated with the sale of any products or components.

* *Prepayments:* Captures Cash Receipts that are above and beyond outstanding sale amounts or subscription balances.  The cash recorded in this item may be applied later to other items as "Deferred Cash Applied".

* *Unallocated Refunds:* Captures the amounts from external refunds, when Chargify cannot determine which Products or Components are being refunded.

For example, consider a customer subscribed to "Pro Plan", with a $0 balance. If you adjust the subscription's balance to $50, nothing happens, because you have not sold anything. Then you record an "External Payment" in the amount of $100. The first $50 will be recorded as Sales, Cash, and Revenue for the "Other Adjustments" item - Chargify does not assume this was for "Pro Plan", so "Other Adjustment" becomes the catch-all account.  The second $50 will be recorded as Cash for the "Prepayments" item, again, because Chargify does not assume this prepayment was for the "Pro Plan".
