Our Salesforce integration will automatically sync Chargify activity to Salesforce.

h2. Availability

The Salesforce integration is available to merchants:

* On the free Developer plan (for testing), OR
* On the Small Business Plus plan or higher

If you would like to test out the integration, but you do not meet these criteria, you may "open a support ticket":https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new and request a one month credit for a free upgrade to the Small Business Plus plan.

For us to connect to your Salesforce account, it must allow access to the Salesforce API. This comes standard on Salesforce Enterprise plans. API access may also be added to other Salesforce plans for an extra fee.  Alternately, you may use a "Salesforce Developer account":https://developer.salesforce.com/signup (not a free trial) for testing.

h2. How to Enable the Integration

The Salesforce integration tab is found within the main Integrations tab on each of your Sites:

To begin exporting data to Salesforce, check the "Enable Continuous Salesforce Exporting" checkbox and then click the "Save Salesforce Settings" button.  The first time you enable the integration, you will need to follow the prompts to grant us access to your Salesforce data.

h2. How it Works

A Customer in Chargify becomes an Account (with associated Contact) in Salesforce.

A Subscription in Chargify becomes a Note attached to the customerâ€™s Account in Salesforce.

We will sync data to Salesforce when a new Subscription is created, when an existing Customer is updated, or when an existing Subscription is updated such as for a renewal, product change, or payment.

Note that if a Customer _without_ a Subscription is created in Chargify, nothing will be synced to Salesforce.

h2. FAQ

h3. Is old activity synced to Salesforce?

No, only new events that happen _after_ you enable the integration will be sent to Salesforce. As subscriptions are updated and renewed, they should eventually all sync to Salesforce.

h3. How many Chargify Sites can I connect to Salesforce?

This Salesforce knowledgebase article on "Managing OAuth Access for Your Connected Apps":https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_request_manage.htm states that "The default limit is five access tokens for each application."
