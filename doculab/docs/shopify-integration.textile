p(note). If you need Shopify integration, we recommend the third-party "Chargify Accounts by eShop Admin" app which will allow your customers to manage their orders and subscriptions through their Shopify customer account. "https://apps.shopify.com/chargify-accounts-by-eshop-admin":https://apps.shopify.com/chargify-accounts-by-eshop-admin.

h1. As of January 2016 the Chargify app for Shopify is no longer available.  Existing installations will continue to be supported but no new sites can be configured.

h2. Documentation for Existing Installations Only

The Chargify app allows you to subscribe your customers to the products they now buy as one-time purchases in your store. Rather than adding their purchases to the shopping cart, your customers will click “Signup” and then be directed to Chargify's customizable Public Signup Pages. Once your customers have subscribed to the product in Chargify, you can use all of our great features to manage your recurring revenue business.

The Chargify app allows you to:
* Setup a site in Chargify
* Create products in Chargify
* Copy those products back to Shopify
* Make “Signup” buttons appear in your Shopify store for each recurring product
* Manage/bill your recurring product customers in Chargify

Check out the Chargify app in the "Shopify App Store":http://apps.shopify.com/chargify.

h1. IMPORTANT: If you are currently using the Chargify app in Shopify, DO NOT delete it.  The Chargify app has been removed from the Shopify app store and it will not be possible to re-install.

h2(#installation). Installation

To get started, you will need to install the Chargify app in your Shopify store.
* Login to your Shopify store.

!/images/doculab/shopify-installation.png!

* **If you don’t have an existing Chargify account**, you will click “Create a New Chargify Account”. A new Chargify account will automatically be created for you.
**If you already have an existing Chargify site set up**, you will enter your Chargify site’s Subdomain and API Key.
Your subdomain can be found by logging into your Chargify account and copying the “subdomain” from the site you wish to link to Shopify:
<center>!/images/doculab/site-settings.png!</center>
The API Key can be found in your Chargify account by clicking on the “API Access” tab in the left hand navigation column on the “Home” screen:
<center>!/images/doculab/api-key.png!</center>

* Click "Connect to My Existing Chargify Site" to complete the installation.

* Click "Begin Setup For My Chargify Account" to continue:
<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-post-installation.png!</center>
You’ll then be redirected to your Chargify account where you will setup your gateway credentials, products, and settings.

h2(#gateway-setup). Gateway Setup

You will need a payment gateway and merchant account to process payments with Chargify. Please note that Shopify Payments is not a Chargify supported gateway, however, Shopify payments is powered by Stripe, which is a supported gateway.

"Stripe":https://www.stripe.com and "Authorize.net":http://www.authorize.net are the 2 most popular supported payment gateways. Stripe has an integrated merchant account, while Authorize.net has teamed with Merchant Focus as a preferred merchant account provider.

For more information, see "Chargify Supported Payment Gateways":https://chargify.com/payment-gateways/

* Click on the “Configure Gateway Credentials” link:
<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-configure-gateway.png!</center>
Your gateway will automatically be set to the “Chargify Test Gateway”. You will be able to process subscriptions in test mode to prepare for making your products live in your Shopify store. This will help to ensure everything is setup and working properly.
(See "Gateway Configuration":https://docs.chargify.com/gateway-configuration here for more information about the Chargify test gateway and test credit card numbers available to force a successful or failed transaction.)

* Once you’re ready to process live transactions and have your gateway and merchant account setup, you will click “USE THIS GATEWAY” next to the gateway of your choice:
<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-gateway-settings.png!</center>

* Chargify requires various pieces of information based on which gateway you are using. Follow the instructions and input the required information in each field provided in the form.
<i>Please note that the gateway and merchant account in your Chargify account will not be the same as your Shopify account. These are separate services and you will need to setup another merchant account in order to process Chargify transactions.</i>

h2(#product-setup). Product Setup

The Chargify app will create a new site in Chargify, in which you’ll create your new recurring products. Please be aware that there is currently no way to utilize products that you already have in an existing Shopify site.

It is important to understand the distinction between Product Families, Products, Components, and Coupons within Chargify. You can learn more about how each one relates to the other by reading the “Products” portion of our documentation: "https://docs.chargify.com/products-intro":https://docs.chargify.com/products-intro

<i>Note: A product family is auto-created when you complete your Shopify integration. To change the product family name, go to the “Setup” tab in your Chargify account and click “edit” next to the product family name.</i>

<b>Create a new Product Family:</b>
* Click on the “Setup” tab
* Click “Create a New Product Family”
* Name your Product family, add a description (the API handle isn’t necessary for the Shopify integration), and press “Create Product Family”

<b>Create a new Product:</b>
* Click on “Create New Product” under your new product family
* Fill in the:
** Product Name
** Description (this description will appear on the Public Signup Page where your customers signup for your recurring subscription products)
** Billing Configuration
** Advanced Options
** Optional Integration Configuration
* Click “Create Product”

h2(#publish). Publishing Chargify Products To Shopify

Now that your recurring products are setup in Chargify, you will need to publish them to your Shopify store.

* Click on the “Integrations” tab in your Chargify account
* Select “Shopify” from the left column
* Press “Publish Your Products To Shopify”

Your Chargify products will be retrieved and a screen will appear with all of the products that are available to publish to your Shopify store:
<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-products.png!</center>

* Click “Add to Shopify” next to the product.
* The product status will update to “hidden”:

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-products-hidden.png!</center>

* Press the “Publish in Shopify” link and you will be brought directly to the new product page in your Shopify dashboard (you will need to do this for each product).
* Add your product photo(s) and additional information.
* All Chargify products require the @product.recurring@ template in order to work properly. Once a product is published in Shopify, scroll to the bottom of the Shopify product page to ensure that the proper template is selected:

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-recurring.png!</center>

* When you’re ready to add the product to your Shopify store, change the product from “Hidden” to “Visible”, or select a specific publish date:

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-visibility.png!</center>

* Press “Save” and view your new recurring product in your Shopify store!

<i>Note: The “Type” and “Vendor” will automatically populate in your Shopify dashboard when a Chargify product is published. Do NOT change these values. Chargify products require the type to remain “Subscription” and the Vendor will display the product family name from your Chargify account:</i>

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-product-type.png!</center>

h2(#verify). Verify The Setup Is Complete

Once the process is complete and you’ve successfully published Chargify products to your Shopify store, you’ll want to verify that the recurring products have a “Signup” button rather than an “Add to Cart” button:

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-product.png!</center>

Click on the “Signup” button to ensure the customer is brought to the Chargify Public Signup Page for checkout instead of the Shopify cart.

<i>Note: Some Shopify templates automatically replace the “Add to Cart” button with the “Signup” button, but some do not. If your store still shows the “Add to Cart” button on your recurring subscription product pages, please follow these additional instructions.</i>

h2(#replace-button). Replacing "Add to Cart" with "Signup" Button

* In your Shopify admin, select “Themes” in the left navigation column.
* Select “Customize theme”.
* Select “Template editor” at the top of the page.
* Select your published theme’s “Template Editor” to edit files:
* Under the “Templates” section, select the @product.recurring.liquid@ template.
You'll need to locate the following code:
<pre><code><input type="submit" id="add-to-cart" class="button" name="add" value="Add to cart" /></code></pre>
<i>Hint: Search for “Add to Cart” within the text using “Ctrl + F” on a PC or “Command + F” on a Mac.</i>
* If your @product.recurring.liquid@ template doesn’t include the “Add to cart” code, then your theme uses “Snippets” and you’ll need to replace the “Add to Cart” button in a different location:
** Under the “Snippets” section, find the corresponding file that matches up with the snippet code referenced in the “product.recurring.liquid” template (for example: @{% include 'product' %}@ would indicate that there is a @product.liquid@ template that contains the “Add to Cart” code shown in step 4.
** Locate the “Add to cart” reference within the code.
** Continue to next step.
* “Add to Cart” input that you’ll replace with the following snippet:
<pre><code>{% if product.metafields.chargify.hosted_signup_url %}
  <a class="button" style="margin-bottom: 5px" href="{{ product.metafields.chargify.hosted_signup_url }}">Signup</a>
{% else %}
  <input type="submit" id="add-to-cart" class="button" name="add" value="Add to cart" />
{% endif %}</code></pre>

h2(#create-order). Automatic Order Creation Upon Signup/Renewal

Chargify can automatically create Orders in your Shopify store when a new subscription is created, or an existing one renews. To enable this functionality, click “Settings” in the top right of the Chargify app, and then enable the “Create a new Order” option, and click “Save Settings”:

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-order-settings.png!</center>

Once that option is enabled, Chargify will turn each new signup and subscription renewal into a new Customer (if one does not already exist) and a new Order within your Shopify store.

You can check on the processing status of events between Chargify and your Shopify shop by clicking on the “Logs” link. Events that have successfully synced between Chargify and Shopify are noted as successful. Events that failed to sync because of an error in communication between Chargify and Shopify (internal server error, etc.) can be queued for reprocessing.

Note: Once we have passed a new order/renewal order to Shopify, we cannot cancel or delete it. If we send an order to Shopify and then someone cancels the subscription in Chargify, the order already in Shopify will remain there.

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-logs.png!</center>

h3(#required). Required Information

<b>Shopify requires both Billing _and_ Shipping Information for valid Shopify “Orders” to be created.</b>

Events that fail to sync because of incomplete data (customer didn’t provide billing or shipping information, for example,) cannot be re-processed by Chargify. They will simply be rejected by Shopify.

Because of this, it is highly recommended that you require billing and shipping information on any Chargify products that you want to have pushed into Shopify when customers sign up for them or when normal subscription renewals occur.

You can do this by logging into your Chargify site, clicking on the “Setup” tab, and clicking “Edit” for any of the applicable products. Then, choose “Require Shipping Address" and "Require Billing Address".

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-product-options.png!</center>

Please note that "Require Payment Method" is also needed in order to collect a billing address, however this is enabled by default and should not need to be modified.

These settings will ensure that Chargify has enough information from your customers to create acceptable Orders in Shopify.

It is currently not possible to have Orders created in Shopify without collecting both a credit card _and_ a billing address, (as well as a shipping address,) even if the product is free.

Once you’re set up, you’ll notice new Orders are automatically created in your Shopify store as they are generated by Chargify:

<center>!/images/doculab/shopify-orders.png!</center>

h3(#order-contents). Components, Coupons, Taxes, and Adjustments

Charges related to the product and any components will show up as line items in new Shopify Orders. Coupons will show up as discounts, and taxes will be applied as such if you have them enabled within Chargify.

A Shopify Order created by Chargify represents the total dollar value of the product, components, coupons, and taxes in a given billing period. Chargify will not take into account any mid-period adjustments that you apply towards a subscription, any one-time charges, or any existing subscription balances.

This can lead to your Shopify revenue total being different than your Chargify revenue total, in the event you utilize the balance adjustment at any point during the current billing period, prior to the order being generated.

This also means that if a subscription goes into dunning and then returns to an active state, an order will be sent to Shopify for the charge that went past-due, even if you adjust (or reset) the balance.  These orders may need to be manually canceled in Shopify.

h2(#trouble). Troubleshooting

* DO NOT DELETE THE CHARGIFY APP FROM SHOPIFY.
* If a product is archived in Chargify, you must manually delete it from your Shopify store.
* Updating your API key in Chargify does NOT affect the Shopify integration. If you receive an error after updating your Chargify API key, clear your browser cache and history and try again.

h2(#faq). FAQ

**How much does Chargify cost?**
When you create a Chargify account through the Shopify app, you are entitled to a one-month free trial.  You will then be assessed our regular fees which are based on the number of paying customers and non-paying users on your account: "https://chargify.com/pricing-and-signup/":https://chargify.com/pricing-and-signup/. There are no per transaction fees.  Our fees are in addition to those assessed by Shopify, your payment gateway and your merchant account provider.

**Will my Chargify orders and customer information appear in my Shopify store?**
If you choose to enable “Create a new order in my Shopify store upon Chargify subscription creation or renewal” in your Chargify app settings, a new customer will be created in Shopify (if one does not already exist) and orders will flow from Chargify to Shopify at signup and each subsequent renewal: "https://chargify.com/blog/shopify-orders/":https://chargify.com/blog/shopify-orders/

If you choose not to enable this setting, no order information will flow into Shopify from Chargify and no customer records will be created.

**Does Chargify work in conjunction with any fulfillment software?**
Chargify currently does not support any integrations with fulfillment software directly, however, this may change in the future. Most Chargify merchants that ship physical products export their subscriptions to a CSV file and use the data to indicate when a product should be shipped.

If you’ve opted to have orders flow into Shopify from Chargify, each time an order is created Chargify will do an API call to get the SKU of the first variant in the Shopify product page and send it with the order information. This will allow most third party fulfillment applications to pick up the SKU (just like a Shopify order).

**Can my customers purchase Shopify and Chargify products and only have to checkout once?**
Currently, each Chargify product must be purchased separately. Your customers will need to purchase recurring products through the Chargify Public Signup Page and any one-time Shopify products through the Shopify shopping cart.

**How can my customers purchase more than a Quantity of 1?**
You can allow multiple quantities of the same recurring product to be purchased at one time by setting up product components and allowing your customer to choose the quantity (or add-on) on the Chargify Public Signup Page: "https://docs.chargify.com/product-components":https://docs.chargify.com/product-components

**Will my Shopify variants get sent to Chargify?**
No. Variants selected on Shopify product pages do not get sent to the Chargify Public Signup Pages. Custom fields can be created in Chargify to allow customers to input text values for sizes, colors, and other variants that don’t add a cost to the subscription.

If a cost should be added to subscription by adding a variant, a component would need to be setup in Chargify to allow the customer to select the add-on: "https://docs.chargify.com/product-components":https://docs.chargify.com/product-components

**How do I charge taxes for my Chargify products?**
Chargify allows you to set tax rates per state. These settings must be edited in your Chargify account: "https://docs.chargify.com/taxes":https://docs.chargify.com/taxes

**How do I charge shipping fees for my Chargify orders?**
You can setup flat rate shipping costs as well as quantity based shipping costs: "https://docs.chargify.com/shipping-charges":https://docs.chargify.com/shipping-charges

**Where can I find my Chargify user name and password?**
When you sign up for Chargify through Shopify, an account is created in Chargify but no login is provided. You can continue to sign in through Shopify by clicking on the Chargify app.

If you’d like to obtain your Chargify login info, you can click “reset password” in Chargify and not effect the Shopify integration. An email will be sent with password reset instructions and you can begin logging into Chargify directly at "http://app.chargify.com":http://app.chargify.com

**Does Chargify support my pricing model?**
Here are some of the most common pricing models that Chargify merchants use: "http://chargify.com/blog/does-chargify-support-my-pricing-model/":http://chargify.com/blog/does-chargify-support-my-pricing-model/

**Can I change the URL on my Chargify Public Signup Page where my customers checkout?**
For example, a URL like: https://shopify-setup-test.chargify.com/h/3418188/subscriptions/new

Yes, but you will need to contact Support for help. If you change your Chargify subdomain, it will break your Shopify integration and Support will need to point it to the new subdomain you’ve chosen.

**I installed the Chargify app, but no longer want it, how can I cancel my Chargify account?**
Prior to uninstalling the Chargify app, you will want to log into Chargify and delete the Chargify account. This can be done by clicking "Billing & Plans", then clicking "Delete My Account" and following the prompts.

After the Chargify account has successfully been deleted, you can remove the Chargify app from Shopify.

Please feel free to contact Chargify Support for assistance: 1 (800) 401-2414 or <a href="mailto:support@chargify.com">support@chargify.com</a>.
