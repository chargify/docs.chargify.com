The Subscriptions Import tool will allow you to import new subscriptions into Chargify from a CSV file.

(Subscriptions can also be imported using the API.  Please see "Subscriptions API Import":api-subscriptions#import for more information.)

p(note). This is an advanced feature which is only recommended for merchants with technical experience in mapping data in CSV format. Limited support will be provided. If you do not feel comfortable with the procedures laid out below, please "open a support ticket":http://help.chargify.com/tickets/new or contact our support team at support@chargify.com or by phone at (800) 401-2414.

Support for the Subscriptions Import feature is available Monday - Thursday during the hours of 9am-5pm Eastern.  In the event an unexpected error occurs, please contact support@chargify.com.

If your customers' payment details are stored in the secure vault of one of our supported gateways (new and existing Chargify merchants):

If you do not have your customers’ payment details and plan on requesting them later or are subscribing them to a free product (new and existing merchants).

"Sample XLSX with No Payment Profiles":/files/subscription_import_no_payment_profile.xlsx

p(note). XLSX files will need to be saved as CSV prior to upload.

"Sample CSV with Vault Tokens":files/subscription_import_vault_tokens.csv

"Sample CSV with No Payment Profiles":files/subscription_import_no_payment_profile.csv

p(note). Editing CSV files in Excel or Numbers can cause formatting issues.  If you wish to edit the files using these programs, please use the XLSX files above, and save them as CSV prior to import.

h2(#notice). Important Notices and Disclaimers

* You must disable all email notifications related to subscription creation if you do not want to alert your customers that you have created the subscription (signup emails, receipts, statements and billing portal invitations)

* We recommend that you limit the number of subscriptions in each import to 100.

* We recommend that you use the tool when our Tier 2 team is available to help with any issues (normally Monday-Thursday, 9a-5p Eastern).

* Billing address cannot be provided unless vault tokens or full card numbers are provided as the billing address is stored with the payment profile. If you are not importing vault tokens or full card numbers, please be sure your product settings do not require payment method or billing address at signup. Once the import is complete, you can re-enable the required fields in your product settings so new signups must enter this information.

* CyberSource requires billing address to process successful transactions. You will not be able to import subscriptions without a vault token or full card number for this gateway.

* When working with credit card data in Excel, long strings of digits are converted into scientific notation. Excel will always convert a long series of digits into scientific notation when you open the source data in Excel (double-clicking the file and opening it in Excel).  To get around the scientific notation conversion, you have to import your csv file into Excel and define the column of digits as "Text" so that Excel will not convert it to scientific notation.  In addition, Excel only records numbers up to 15 digits if they are not entered as text.  Any additional digits are reset to 0.

<b>The system will reject all CSV files which are formatted incorrectly.</b>  The most common formatting issues relate to illegal characters such as commas or foreign symbols/characters.

!/images/doculab/subscriptions-import-success.png!

h2(#trouble). Troubleshooting

The system will generate error messages when individual subscriptions fail.  In this case, the customer email field was left blank:

!/images/doculab/subscriptions-import-error.png!

p(note). The import job is aborted if 10 successive entries fail to create a subscription.  This can happen if the data is not formatted correctly, or if the gateway declines the initial authorization or charge.

When one or more subscriptions fail, you can upload the same CSV file after making corrections.  The system will ignore any subscriptions which were imported successfully.  There is no need to remove those entries from the CSV file.

Please "open a support ticket":http://help.chargify.com/tickets/new if you require assistance.  You can also reach us via email at support@chargify.com or by phone at (800) 401-2414.


h2(#faq). FAQ

h3(#components). Can I include component allocations in the CSV file?

Unfortunately, no.  Components can be added after the subscriptions are imported either by "Setting Component Allocations":/setting-component-allocations in the Admin UI, or via the API using the "Allocations":/api-allocations and "Metered Usage":/api-metered-usage endpoints.
