A Chargify *Merchant* (also sometimes called a *Seller*) may have many *Sites*, each of which sell *Subscriptions* to *Products*.  Subscriptions are purchased by *Customers*, giving them access to a Product.

h3. Merchant

Assuming you have a Chargify account, then the Merchant is you!

You may also see "Merchant" referred to as a "Seller" - after all, in economics, we're all just buyers and sellers.

h3. Sites

Each seller may have as many "Sites" as they wish. A Site is a container for your Products, Subscriptions, and Customers. Each Site has its own settings and configuration. In particular, each site defines its own subdomain, currency, and gateway settings. Any reporting that Chargify performs is done at the Site level.

For more about Sites, see "Configure your Site":/quick-start-site

h3. Products

Products are the things that you sell. You must have Products set up in order to sell or initiate Subscriptions.

Products are grouped in to *Product Families*. Typically, a Product Family groups the Products between which your Customers may upgrade and downgrade.

Consider the following example of the pricing page from "grasshopper.com":http://grasshopper.com.

If mapped in to Chargify, *the Products would be*:

* Ramp
* Grow
* Max

*All of these Products would be apart of the same Product Family*, the Grasshopper Virtual Phone System.  Customers are free to upgrade and downgrade between the different products, and Customers typically only have access to one of the Product in the Product Family at a time.

h3. Subscriptions

Subscriptions are central in Chargify.

* Subscriptions tie a Customer to a particular Product
* A Subscription has a recurring interval called a *period*
* Subscriptions go through different states as a part of their lifecycle, i.e. _active_ and _canceled_

When Subscriptions are processed (according to their _period_), any balance due is collected as a payment from the credit card that is on file for that Subscription.

h3. Customers

Customers are the people or entities that buy access to your Products via Subscriptions.
