h3. Adding Users

You have the option of adding more user accounts (login and password) to your Seller account, if you are an Admin or Owner, so that other people can help you with its management.

Starting on your Seller homepage, navigate to the "Users" tab and click on the "Create New User" link.

There are 3 levels of access for user accounts:

* *Owner*: The first user account is the "owner" of the Seller account.  They have implicit admin capabilities that cannot be revoked.
* *Admin*: Any user may be made an Admin by the owner or by the other Admins.
* *Team Member*: A user on the account without Admin privileges.

Team Member access controls are currently available on our "Pro":https://www.chargify.com/sign-up/ and higher plans.  Read more about "Access Control and User Permissions":https://www.chargify.com/blog/access-controls/ on our blog.
