Webhooks offer a way to quickly find out about changes to your Subscriptions that happen within Chargify.  You can subscribe to events of interest, and we'll post data to the URL you specify when one of those events occurs.

p(note). Webhooks will eventually replace our "Post-back":post-backs system.<br/><br/>

h2. Webhook Contents

Webhooks are sent as HTTP POST requests to your URL with a form-encoded body (@Content-Type:  application/x-www-form-urlencoded@) for easy parsing in almost any programming language.  All Webhooks contain the following keys:

| @event@   | An identifier for the type of event that occurred. See "Events":#events, below  |
| @payload@ | A hash of pertinent data about the event                                        |

For example, test Webhooks are sent with the following body:

<pre><code>event=test&payload[chargify]=testing</code></pre>

h2(#events). Events

The following events are monitored within Chargify and can generate Webhooks:

|_. Event Key |_. Trigger |_. Payload |
| @signup_success@  | Any successful signup (Subscription created) via the API, admin UI, or hosted pages | @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @signup_failure@  | Any failed signup (Subscription failed to begin) via the API, admin UI, or hosted pages<sup>2</sup> | @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @renewal_success@ | A successful periodic renewal<sup>3</sup> | @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @renewal_failure@ | A failed periodic renewal, i.e. the credit card is declined<sup>3</sup> | @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @payment_success@ | Any successful payment against a credit card<sup>4</sup> | @payment@ |
| @payment_failure@ | Any failed payment attempt against a credit card<sup>4</sup> | @payment@ |
| @billing_date_change@ | Any change to the billing date that is initiated explicitly by altering the billing date via the admin UI or the API.  This will not be triggered upon a normal renewal and period advancement | @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @subscription_state_change@ | Any change to the Subscription state.  This is the "workhorse" of the events - watching this event can tell you if a Subscription ever moves to a "bad" state, i.e. @past_due@ | @subscription@<sup>1,5</sup> |
| @expiring_card@ | A periodic event sent by Chargify | @subscription@<sup>1,6</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> The @subscription@ object also contains information on the Customer and Product.
<sup>2</sup> This is usually caused by a failure at the payment gateway.  This event is not generated for input validation errors (i.e. forgetting to fill in a field).
<sup>3</sup> At the end of every recurring interval, _either_ a @renewal_success@ _or_ a @renewal_failure@ event is triggered once.  If a card is declined and a @renewal_failure@ is triggered, a subsequent payment that brings the account current will _not_ generate a @renewal_success@ (although it will generate a @payment_success@ and a @subscription_state_change@)
<sup>4</sup> @payment_success@ or @payment_failure@ are triggered for _every_ payment attempted, whether it is for a normal renewal, or a "One-time Charge":one-time-charges, or a retry after failure.
<sup>5</sup> Note that the @subscription@ object you are given contains keys for both @previous_state@ and @state@ so you can track the changes.
<sup>6</sup> The @expiring_card@ webhook is sent on the 1st, 15th and 7 days before the end of the month. This will identify all cards expiring in the next month.

p(note). Multiple Webhook events may be triggered by a single system event.  For example, the creation of a new Subscription will typically fire both a @signup_success@ and @payment_success@ event (if a payment was necessary to start the Subscription).

h2. Payload Resources

The resource objects sent as payload contain the same information as the corresponding API resource.  To see the attribute keys that are sent with the Subscription and Payment payload objects, see the API documentation.  (Payment objects are a type of Transaction resource)

* "API Subscription resources":/api-subscriptions
* "API Transaction resources":/api-transactions

h2. Webhook Verification

Using your "Site shared key":#finding-your-site-shared-key and a "signature" that is calculated and sent with the Webhook, you can verify the contents of a Webhook as being authentic and un-tampered.

p(warning). Guard your Site shared key as you would your password, since a hacker with your Site shared key could generate Webhooks with a payload and signature that passes the signature verification test.

Webhooks are signed with a signature generated by taking an MD5 hex digest of a string formed by concatenating the shared key with the raw body of the Webhook post.  In pseudo-code:

<pre><code>MD5::hexdigest(site.shared_key + webhook.body)</code></pre>

If your site shared key is @123@ and the Webhook request body contents are @payload[chargify]=testing&event=test@, then the signature for this Webhook is @3df5f2c8d2bfd40d8a8d72cb9e7fe56c@.

This signature is sent with the Webhook post in the header @X-Chargify-Webhook-Signature@, and can also be sent as a query param in your URL by using the @{signature}@ replacement variable.

For example, you could give us the following URL as your Webhook target URL:

<pre><code>http://example.com/?signature={signature}</code></pre>

We would post the example Webhook to the following address:

<pre><code>http://example.com/?signature=3df5f2c8d2bfd40d8a8d72cb9e7fe56c</code></pre>

You can thus verify the contents of the POST by taking the same hash yourself and comparing.

We will soon be offering a 2nd layer of verification, wherin you can send the Webhook ID and Signature to Chargify and get back a pass/fail response as to whether it matches one we in fact sent.

p(note). When in doubt, you can always verify the information contained in a Webhook by checking current resource state via our "API":/api-introduction.

h3(#finding-your-site-shared-key). Finding Your Site Shared Key

When you create a Site, a shared key is automatically generated for you.  You can find its current value, and change it if you choose, by clicking "Edit current Site" from the Site dropdown menu in the utility bar near the top of the screen.

h2. Configuring Webhooks

You can configure your Webhooks from the Settings tab for each Site.  You can choose to enable Webhooks, provide a target Webhook URL, and subscribe to individual Webhooks. The target Webhook URL cannot contain any port number except 80 and 443 (which you can specify using @http@ and @https@ protocol).

h2. Webhook Testing

On the Webhook configuration screen on the Settings tab, you can click "Send a test Webhook" to access the Webhook testing panel.  There, we will attempt to send a Webhook to your configured URL and show you what we sent and the response we received from you.

p(note). Testing tip: try creating a Postbin at "http://postbin.org":http://postbin.org and use that as your Webhook test URL.  That way, you can inspect the Webhook contents and headers while you work out your own Webhook handler. Also, you can add your own url on the end of your Postbin URL and the webhook events will pass-through to your own URL. The format for a pass-through URL is: @http://postbin.org/{postbin_id}?{your_url}@
