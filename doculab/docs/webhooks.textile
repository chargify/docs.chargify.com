Webhooks offer a way to quickly find out about changes to your Subscriptions that happen within Chargify.  You can subscribe to events of interest, and we'll post data to the URL you specify when one of those events occurs.

p(note). Webhooks are recommended over "Post-backs":post-backs for your integration.<br><br>

h2(#asynchronous). Webhooks are Asynchronous

p(note). Webhook events usually get sent quickly, but sometimes there can be a small delay (if you experience a delay longer than a few minutes please contact us).

Webhooks are asynchronous events.  We do our best to always send them in a timely manner, but we do not recommend on relying on webhooks for events that are very time sensitive.

A good example of this is your signup path.  We do not recommend that you block a user from moving forward with provisioning or signup on your side based on a webhook response.  All of our signup paths have synchronous methods of being notified of the event:

* With hosted page signups, you can use the "Return URLs and Return URL Parameters":/product-options#return-url-and-parameters as a hint of the signup.  You can use this hint to make a synchronous API fetch to learn more about the subscription
* With API signups, you can use the response from the subscription creation request to take action without waiting on a webhook

h2. Webhook Contents

Webhooks are sent as HTTP POST requests to your URL with a form-encoded body (@Content-Type:  application/x-www-form-urlencoded@) for easy parsing in almost any programming language.  All Webhooks contain the following keys:

| @id@      | A unique, numeric, identifier for the webhook.  You can use this value to record which webhooks you've already seen or recorded or acted on |
| @event@   | An identifier for the type of event that occurred. See "Events":#events, below  |
| @payload@ | A "hash" of pertinent data about the event.  Keys and sub-keys in the hash are denoted using square bracket notation in the key.  For example, the product name would be included as the following form-encoded key/pair value in the content body of a @signup_success@ webhook: @payload[subscription][product][name]=Basic@ |

Test Webhooks are sent with the following body:

<pre><code>id=123456&event=test&payload[chargify]=testing</code></pre>

Examples of payloads for other event types is given in the section on "Example Payloads":#example-payloads.

h2(#retries). Webhook Acknowledgement and Automatic Retries

Upon receipt of a webhook, you should **accept** it by returning an HTTP "200 OK" response as quickly as possible.  Sending any other response (i.e. "500 Internal Server Error", "404 Not Found", etc.) OR failing to return a response within approximately 15 seconds will result in automatic retries of the webhooks.

Chargify will attempt to send each webhook 5 times before giving up.  The webhook retries will follow a backoff schedule:

|_. Attempt |_. Approximate Timing |
| 1         | As soon as possible after the original event |
| 2         | 10 seconds after most recent failure |
| 3         | 15 seconds after most recent failure |
| 4         | 90 seconds after most recent failure |
| 5         | 180 seconds after most recent failure |

If you use the Webhook Replay feature (available via the "Webhook API":/api-webhooks or the Webhook Panel, if available on your plan), please be aware that it is possible to perform a manual replay while automatic replays are still active.  Because of this, it is your responsibility to avoid taking duplicate action.  Suggestions for avoiding duplicate actions are:

* Use the unique webhook @id@ to remember which webhooks you've already recorded
* Do not attempt to replay webhooks until the @last_attempt_at@ timestamp (see "Metadata":#metadata) is well outside of the automatic replay intervals

h2(#events). Events

The following events are monitored within Chargify and can generate Webhooks:

|_. Event Key |_. Trigger |_. Payload |
| @signup_success@  | Any successful signup (Subscription created) via the API, admin UI, or hosted pages | @site@, @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @signup_failure@  | Any failed signup (Subscription failed to begin) via the API, admin UI, or hosted pages<sup>2</sup> | @site@, @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @renewal_success@ | A successful periodic renewal<sup>3</sup> | @site@, @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @renewal_failure@ | A failed periodic renewal, i.e. the credit card is declined<sup>3</sup> | @site@, @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @payment_success@ | Any successful payment against a credit card<sup>4</sup> | @site@, @payment@ |
| @payment_failure@ | Any failed payment attempt against a credit card<sup>4</sup> | @site@, @payment@ |
| @billing_date_change@ | Any change to the billing date that is initiated explicitly by altering the billing date via the admin UI or the API.  This will not be triggered upon a normal renewal and period advancement, or a migration. | @site@, @subscription@<sup>1</sup> |
| @subscription_state_change@ | Any change to the Subscription state.  This is the "workhorse" of the events - watching this event can tell you if a Subscription ever moves to a "bad" state, i.e. @past_due@ | @site@, @subscription@<sup>1,5</sup> |
| @subscription_product_change@ | A successful change from an old product to a new product within the users Subscription. | @site@, @product_change@ |
| @expiring_card@ | A periodic event sent by Chargify | @site@, @subscription@<sup>1,6</sup> |
| @customer_update@ | Any change to the following customer fields: @first_name@, @last_name@, @organization@, @email@, @reference@, @address@, @address 2@, @city@, @state@, @zip@, @country@, @phone@. | @site@, @customer@ |
| @component_allocation_change@ | Any change to a subscription's quantity-based component allocation or enabled status of an on/off component that is made _after_ signup.<br/><br/>This webhook does not fire if allocations are set as a part of the subscription creation (i.e. signup) - it only fires upon subsequent changes. (We will soon be making component allocations available in the @signup_success@ webhook to cover the sign up case)<br/><br/>@previous_allocation@ and @new_allocation@ give the allocation values before and after the change.  These will be either @0@ or @1@ for On/Off Components to represent @off@ and @on@, respectively.<br/><br/>@timestamp@ provides the date and time the allocation was recorded and is listed in "ISO8601":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 format in the UTC timezone. Note: this timestamp format differs slightly from the format of existing timestamps in other event types and represents our new direction for webhook timestamps.| <pre><code>site[id]
site[subdomain]
component[id]
component[name]
component[unit_name]
component[kind]
subscription[id]
subscription[name]
product[id]
product[name]
previous_allocation
new_allocation
memo
timestamp</code></pre> |
| @metered_usage@ | Any reported usage for a subscription's metered components.<br/><br/>This webhook will not fire when the unit balance is reset to 0 at the time of renewal.<br/><br/>@timestamp@ provides the date and time the usage was recorded and is listed in "ISO8601":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 format in the UTC timezone. Note: this timestamp format differs slightly from the format of existing timestamps in other event types and represents our new direction for webhook timestamps.| <pre><code>site[id]
site[subdomain]
component[id]
component[name]
component[unit_name]
component[kind]
subscription[id]
subscription[name]
product[id]
product[name]
previous_unit_balance
new_unit_balance
usage_quantity
memo
timestamp</code></pre> |
| @upgrade_downgrade_success@  | Any successful upgrade/downgrade  | @site@, @subscription@, @previous_product@ |
| @upgrade_downgrade_failure@  | Any failed upgrade/downgrade  | @site@, @subscription@, @target_product@ |

<sup>1</sup> The @subscription@ object also contains information on the Customer and Product.
<sup>2</sup> This is usually caused by a failure at the payment gateway.  This event is not generated for input validation errors (i.e. forgetting to fill in a field).
<sup>3</sup> At the end of every recurring interval, _either_ a @renewal_success@ _or_ a @renewal_failure@ event is triggered once.  If a card is declined and a @renewal_failure@ is triggered, a subsequent payment that brings the account current will _not_ generate a @renewal_success@ (although it will generate a @payment_success@ and a @subscription_state_change@)
<sup>4</sup> @payment_success@ or @payment_failure@ are triggered for _every_ payment attempted, whether it is for a normal renewal, or a "One-time Charge":one-time-charges, or a retry after failure.
<sup>5</sup> Note that the @subscription@ object you are given contains keys for both @previous_state@ and @state@ so you can track the changes.
<sup>6</sup> The @expiring_card@ webhook is sent on the 1st, 15th and 7 days before the end of the month. This will identify all cards expiring in the next month.

p(note). Multiple Webhook events may be triggered by a single system event.  For example, the creation of a new Subscription will typically fire both a @signup_success@ and @payment_success@ event (if a payment was necessary to start the Subscription).

h2. Payloads

The resource objects sent as payload typically contain the same information as the corresponding API resource.  Site payload objects contain the site's @id@ and @subdomain@. Examples of payloads for each type of event are given below under "Example Payloads":#example-payloads.


h2. Webhook Verification

Using your "Site shared key":#finding-your-site-shared-key and a "signature" (called @signature_hmac_sha_256@) that is calculated and sent with the Webhook, you can verify the contents of a Webhook as being authentic and un-tampered.

p(warning). <b>Deprecation:</b> Previously, the signature was calculated using the MD5 hex digest. This method is now deprecated: do not use it.  We include BOTH the old signature (called @signature@) and the new signature (called @signature_hmac_sha_256@) to allow for backwards compatibility.  <b>Ignore</b> @signature@.  We will stop sending the old MD5 signature after a sufficient period of time has passed to allow everyone to upgrade.

p(warning). Guard your Site shared key as you would your password, since a hacker with your Site shared key could generate Webhooks with a payload and signature that passes the signature verification test.

Webhooks are signed with a signature generated by taking an HMAC-SHA-256 hex digest of the raw HTTP Body of the Webhook post, using your shared key as the secret.  In ruby:

<pre><code>OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest::Digest.new('sha256'), site.shared_key, webhook.body)</code></pre>

If your site shared key is @123@ and the Webhook request body contents are @payload[chargify]=testing&event=test@, then the @signature_hmac_sha_256@ for this Webhook is @19826d51b9f866b26eda1f154de192593360f8d0bcb63df8a28540a5dcf733f1@.

This signature is sent with the Webhook post in the header @X-Chargify-Webhook-Signature-Hmac-Sha-256@, and can also be sent as a query param in your URL by using the @{signature_hmac_sha_256}@ replacement variable.

For example, you could give us the following URL as your Webhook target URL:

<pre><code>http://example.com/?signature_hmac_sha_256={signature_hmac_sha_256}</code></pre>

We would post the example Webhook to the following address:

<pre><code>http://example.com/?signature_hmac_sha_256=19826d51b9f866b26eda1f154de192593360f8d0bcb63df8a28540a5dcf733f1</code></pre>

You can thus verify the contents of the POST by taking the same hash yourself and comparing.

We will soon be offering a 2nd layer of verification, wherein you can send the Webhook ID and Signature to Chargify and get back a pass/fail response as to whether it matches one we in fact sent.

p(note). When in doubt, you can always verify the information contained in a Webhook by checking current resource state via our "API":/api-introduction.

h3(#finding-your-site-shared-key). Finding Your Site Shared Key

When you create a Site, a shared key is automatically generated for you.  You can find its current value, and change it if you choose, by clicking "Edit current Site" from the Site dropdown menu in the utility bar near the top of the screen.

h2. Configuring Webhooks

You can configure your Webhooks from the Settings tab for each Site.  You can choose to enable Webhooks, provide a target Webhook URL, and subscribe to individual Webhooks. The target Webhook URL cannot contain any port number except 80 and 443 (which you can specify using @http@ and @https@ protocol).

h2. Webhook Testing

On the Webhook configuration screen on the Settings tab, you can click "Send a test Webhook" to access the Webhook testing panel.  There, we will attempt to send a Webhook to your configured URL and show you what we sent and the response we received from you.

p(note). Testing Tip: Try creating a "Request Bin" at "http://requestb.in/":http://requestb.in/ and use that as your Webhook test URL.  That way, you can inspect the Webhook contents and headers while you work out your own Webhook handler.

h2(#metadata). Webhook Metadata

The Webhook records contain information about the acceptance or non-acceptance by your application, along with information about any error received that indicated non-acceptance.

This data is available via the "Webhook API":/api-webhooks or the Webhook Panel, if that feature is available on your plan.

The webhook metadata attributes are:

* @id@ The unique identifier for the webhooks (unique across all of Chargify).  This is not changed on a retry/replay of the same webhook, so it may be used to avoid duplicate action for the same event.
* @successful@ A boolean flag describing whether the webhook was accepted by the webhook endpoint *for the most recent attempt*. (Acceptance is defined by receiving a "200 OK" HTTP response within a reasonable timeframe, i.e. 15 seconds)
* @created_at@ Timestamp indicating when the Webhook was created
* @accepted_at@ Timestamp indicating when the Webhook was accepted by the merchant endpoint.  When a webhook is explicitly replayed by the merchant, this value will be cleared until it is accepted again.
* @last_sent_at@ Timestamp indicating when the most recent attempt was made to send the Webhook
* @last_error_at@ Timestamp indicating when the last non-acceptance occurred.  If a webhooks is later resent and accepted, this field will be cleared.
* @last_error@ Text describing the status code and/or error from the last failed attempt to send the Webhook.  When a webhook is retried and accepted, this field will be cleared.

Webhooks also maintain their event and payload data (accessible via the API).  For a full listing of attributes available for each webhook, please see the "Webhook API":/api-webhooks documentation.
Once a webhook is accepted, the @accepted_at@ timestamp will be filled (which can be viewed via the "Webhooks API":/api-webhooks or in the Webhooks Panel, if it is available for your plan).
